# Map APP



## Introduction



Map APP is a single page application(**SPA**) featuring a map of Moab UT neighborhood I visited. The map includes my favourite locations, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. Each location is incorperated with third-party APIs that provide additional images from Flikr about it. 

The code uses a **Knockout** observables to automatically display/update filtered locations in the list as well as in the map. It also utilizes the **Google Maps API** and **Flickr** image search API, all data requests are retrieved in an asynchronous manner.
